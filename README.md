# Project_ENSIBS_NetworkSecurity
As part of our work in the company, our working group aims to restore a company's network to working order and to secure it by implementing several solutions. These solutions will be: setting up a firewall (Pfsense), configuring the company's servers, setting up a partnership with the partner company (group 2) with an IPSec VPN, deploying SSL and SSH VPN access and implementation of a NIDS/NIPS solution.
